# If the text is empty (nothing between the double quotes),
#    the message will not be sent (a.k.a. the message is "disabled"), for example:
#
#    kick: "" <-- this will disable the message
#
#    If you don't want to use embed messages you can use pure text, for ex.:
#
#    kick: "The player %player% was kicked by %staff%"
